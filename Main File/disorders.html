            <h1>Disorders</h1> 
            <h2>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</h2>
             <p>ADHD is a behavioral disorder that is usually diagnosed in childhood. It is caused by brain differences that affect attention and behavior, making it difficult to regulate and control focus. People with ADHD may also have difficulty with executive functioning, sensory sensitivities, and social environments.</p> 
             <ul> <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Difficulty focusing, concentrating, and staying on task. They may not listen well to directions, may miss important details, and may not finish what they start.</li> <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> May act without thinking about what the result will be.</li> <li><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> In some cases, hyperactivity may be a symptom of ADHD.</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms usually occur together, but one may occur without the others. ADHD can affect a person at school, at home, and with friends. Symptoms can include carelessness and lack of attention to detail, continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones, poor organizational skills, difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness, and restlessness.</p> <p>With the right support and treatment, people with ADHD can create a life that allows them to reach their greatest potential.</p> <h2>Dysgraphia</h2> <p>Dysgraphia is a neurological condition that affects a person's ability to write for their age level. It can affect the physical act of writing, as well as translating thoughts into written words.</p> <p>Dysgraphia is characterized by messy, illegible handwriting and difficulty putting thoughts on paper. It can also affect fine motor skills and skills like typing and spelling.</p> <ul> <li>Difficulty forming letter shapes</li> <li>Tight, awkward, or painful grip on a pencil</li> <li>Difficulty following a line or staying within margins</li> <li>Trouble with sentence structure or following rules of grammar when writing, but not when speaking</li> <li>Difficulty organizing or articulating thoughts on paper</li> </ul> <p>Dysgraphia is usually treated by a combination of fine motor skill training and compensatory accommodations.</p> <h2>Dyscalculia</h2> <p>Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that makes it difficult for people to understand math and number-based information. It can also be described as a math learning disability.</p> <p>Dyscalculic students struggle with math-related concepts. Otherwise known as "number dyslexia," dyscalculia might mean a student finds it difficult to count backward and forward. Dyscalculics commonly struggle to solve simple math problems, sequence numbers, connect numbers to amounts, and read analog clocks.</p> <ul> <li>Difficulty recognizing numbers</li> <li>Delays in learning to count</li> <li>Difficulty connecting numerical symbols with their corresponding words</li> <li>Difficulty recognizing patterns and placing things in order</li> <li>Losing track when counting</li> <li>Needing to use visual aids to help count</li> </ul> <h2>Dyslexia</h2> <p>Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.</p> <p>Other common challenges include recalling phone numbers, addresses, and anything related to rote memory, spelling, and cursive writing. People with dyslexia may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear. This can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills.</p> <p>Signs of dyslexia in primary school age include: speed of processing: slow spoken or written language, poor concentration, difficulty following instructions, and forgetting words.</p> <h2>ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)</h2> <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. It's caused by differences in the brain and is usually called autism. Symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life, but autism can be diagnosed at any age.</p> <ul> <li>Problems with social communication and interaction</li> <li>Restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests</li> <li>Different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention</li> <li>Repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping</li> </ul> <p>With the right support and resources, people with autism can live normal lives. Early intervention, education, and community support are key factors in helping people with autism achieve their goals and lead fulfilling lives.</p> </body> </html>
