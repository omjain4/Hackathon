        <h1>ALBERT EINSTINR</h1>
        <p>Albert Einstein did not have ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). However, he faced challenges and setbacks in his early education. He struggled with traditional teaching methods and often clashed with authority figures. Despite these difficulties, Einstein's curiosity and passion for learning drove him to pursue his interests independently.

            Einstein's success story is a testament to the importance of embracing individual strengths and unconventional approaches. He didn't conform to societal expectations but followed his own path, eventually revolutionizing physics with his groundbreaking theories.
            
            So, while Einstein did not overcome ASD, his story highlights the power of perseverance, individuality, and following one's passion to achieve success.</p></b>
